# TLDR; What font should I use for my figures? 

For a scientific figure you want a font that tick most of these condition: 
- [x]] Readable (i.e. a Sans-serif or slab font)
- [x] Available glyph to render greek and mathematical symbols
- [x] Different weight to at least have a bold option 

Knowing this, you do you, but here a list of font I advise (and you will see they don't tick all the box, which I explain more if you go down the rabbit hole): 
- Condensed font (my current phase)
    1. [Aktiv Grotesk Condensed](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk-condensed) by Dalton Maag _(adobe cc)_
    2. [IBM Plex Condensed](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) by IBM _(sil open font license)_
    2. [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson _(open source)_
    4. Bebas Neue Pro by Ryoichi Tsunekawa From Dharma Type. _(adobe cc)_
    6. Gotham XNarrow by Frere Jones _(commercial license)_
- Standard kerning: 
    1. [IBM Plex Sans]((https://www.ibm.com/plex/)) by IBM _(sil open font license)_
    2. Helvetica Neue by Max Miedinger **‚Üí to be honest the easiest since Nature portfolio will basically force you to use this (Booohh!!!)**
    3. [Cooper Hewitt](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/open-source-at-cooper-hewitt/cooper-hewitt-the-typeface-by-chester-jenkins/) by Chester Jenkins _(SIL Open Font License.)_


If you have an Adobe creative cloud license, either you can activate them directly (like Aktiv Grotest) or for the open source one, you can install them on your machine since they are free (like Inter or Cooper Hewitt). If you want, there are some extraodinary font out there (like Gotham), which may not be free. Keep in mind that designing a font is a extremelly complex task that require expertise and time, hence the price.


# Want to go down the rabbit hole? 

I'm not a trained graphic design, and probably a professional would tell you that what is written below may not be completly correct and accurate. Below is what I have gathered after years of going down the rabbit hole of graphic designs and typography (mostly triggered by the episode of ??? on tiphography). Although there are rules to make something looks good (which can go as far as the psychology of the reader, and eye motion), what is pretty will be subjective to you. Hence, take it or leave it everythign below.
Here I will talk mostly about typography and fonts. If you want my take on graphic design for scientific figures, go to [my Adobe Illustrator asset folder](../IllustratorsStyles)
