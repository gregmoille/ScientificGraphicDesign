## Using the figure in the slidedeck

I won't judge if you use powerpoint, but knows that you will have a very much nonneglible chance that your slideck won't display properly at a conference. To this extend, I highly recommand using Beamer (LaTeX for presentation if you want) which, beyond making presentation easier once you get hang of it, will also output a pdf that can be made lightweuight and ensure that your presentation will look the same on every computer since pdf is a standard.
