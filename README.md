# Couple of disclaimers

This repo aims to helps users create pretty figures for publication or presentation following basic graphic design guidelines. I will only take requests that benefit the community. I may share workflow tips for Blender/Adobe Illustrator if needed. Feel free to tweak and contribute via pull requests!

If you use this work, please let me know by [email](mailto:gmoile@umd.edu) or any other [means](https://srinivasan.jqi.umd.edu/people/gregory-moille)---I'll be glad to hear it's being put to good use!

# What is it about? 

Just some compilation of tips, tricks and stuff that I found over the years of making scientific figures and presentations. I will try to keep it updated as I learn new things, but don't expect much either

# How to use this repository? 

This repository is organized by graphic design aspects, allowing users to focus on specific sections of interest. For those seeking only boilerplates or example files, these can be accessed directly without consulting the tutorials.


# Basic Graphic Design 

I am not going to go over the basics of graphic design much. The only two things that I want to emphasize are:

1. Learn how to use a [color wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/).
2. Make sure you understand the [meaning of color](https://webflow.com/blog/color-meanings) (e.g., red = bad, green = good, blue = calm/modern, etc.). So don't use a red color for something you want to highlight as good.
3. Learn [how to use a grid](https://uxplanet.org/grids-in-graphic-design-a-quick-history-and-5-top-tips-29c8c0650d18).
4. Know that not everybody sees things like you, and make sure your design is inclusive and accessible for color blindness. Use tools (pranatopia or deuteranopia mode in Adobe Illustrator) and do not solely rely on solid curves.

Beyond that, if there are some things that are of interest, I highly recommend the following resources (and if you know me, you can probably ask me to borrow a copy of the books):
